        #then we need to get like 5->4->3->2->1->None
    #here we will be calling like 1->2->3->4->5->None as 2->3->4->5->None from here u will be getting like 5->4->3->2->None here small head is pointing to 5 and a reference is maintained to it.(i.e curr) it works till it is curr.next is not None ,if it is none it will get stopped 

        #now trying to implement  the function

#after that print linked list
printLL(head)



    #small ex:
    #1->2->3  this will call
    # we will call on 
    # 2->3 to get reversed this will call on
    # 3->None to get reversed 
    #now this linked list is same as the reversed linked list
    #now finally we will get like 3->2->1->None as our expected output

    #dry run for the reverse function
    # 1->2->3->4->->None,here initially head is 1 
    #it checks for the if condition,it gets fails
    #now it will call on 2->3-4->None (here head is 2)
    #again it checks the condition and it gets fails
    #we will go to reverse
    # and we will  get like 3->4->None
    #4->None
    #Now in 3->4 we got like in small head we got referece of 4,now put curr head to be small head i.e 4
    #4s next we need is 3
    # 4-3->None since our small head is 4  then it will return .small head has been return 4 to 2
    #now u have called for 2->3->4 ,in the small head   we got like 4->3->2->None
    #finally we will get like 4->3->2->None as our output


    #first please add to github after bug solving

    #please take a note there is a bug in this code and and i am commiting this please refer you tube for this and please take a time complexity analysis as well
